# git-it-done-bunnies
project for module 6 of the bootcamp

## What did I learn during this module?
I learned how to read server-sdie API documentation, that a server-side API can be used to accessing another site's data. I also learned how to capture user input from the browser to create dynamic HTTP requests, use this HTTP request's espone to display data to a user, and handler any errors that might occur when working with server-side APIs. I gained experience passing information between pages with query parameters, read from query string and dredirect pages and creating a dynamic API call based on a user selection.
